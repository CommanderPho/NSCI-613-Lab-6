# NSCI-613-Lab-6
The code for the UMich NSCI 613 Lab 6 during the Fall 2020 Semester


## Disclaimer:
**Do not submit any part of this work as your own**, it is provided only to aid in your own learning process by allowing you to compare your implementations and conclusions with those of a peer. I also make no claims about the correctness of the code or these results, this is simply my final graded submission, but I got an A in the module and generally missed very few points in the labs.

Not all code present may be needed to produce the results, I often play around and explore different ways of analyzing and visualizing data.
